## [6.0.0] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- Removed Foundry V13 deprecation warnings.

## [5.2.2] - 2024-07-29

### Fixed

- Removed leading operator from the dice terms.

## [5.2.1] - 2024-06-27

### Fixed

- A bug where a "Head" result on the location/hit die would result in a success count in T2K games.

## [5.2.0] - 2024-06-07

### Added

- Options added to create a YearZeroRoll can now be retrieved in the tooltip template: see `YearZeroRoll#getTooltip()`. This can be used to pass extra informations from your roll directly into your own custom tooltip template. See also `YearZeroRoll#getRollInfos()` which renders the infos template (a section below the tooltip) and where the whole `roll` property was already accessible for your custom template.

### Fixed

- Compatibility with Foundry V12.

## [5.1.1] - 2023-04-18

### Fixed

- A bug where the T2K rolls with 1 die where not modified correctly.

## [5.1.0] - 2022-12-04

### Added

- New **DiceTerm.Result** parameter `locked` (boolean): When set to true, the result cannot be pushed, but is still _active_ and counted for the total.
- Foundry V10 compatibility for the manifest.

### Fixed

- Negative modifiers are now correctly applied to ALIEN RPG rolls with stress.

### Removed

- DOCUMENTATION.md is removed in favor of JSDocs-generated documentation.

## [5.0.0] - 2022-05-22

> :warning: **BREAKING CHANGES**
> Although V4 was released recently (with a minor breaking change), this version brings many more refactoring to the global and constants names.
> This change was much needed as there were ambiguities between YearZeroDie.TYPE and DieTypeString.
> Also, the YearZeroRoll.forge method has been super-charged.

The main changes are:

- Learn the API easily with the new JS documentation.
- Create and register new custom dice on the fly.
- More powerful `YearZeroRoll.forge()` method.
- (Breaking) Renamed properties in the YZUR global constant.

_See this [pull request](https://github.com/Stefouch/t2k4e/pull/99) for an example of what changes were needed for a game system._

### Added

- **[Comprehensive JS documentation](https://stefouch.github.io/foundry-year-zero-roller/)** in `docs/`.
- `YearZeroRollManager.registerCustomDie(term, data)`: Registers a custom die in Foundry.
- `YearZeroRollManager.createDieClass(data)`: Creates a new custom Die class that extends the YearZeroDie class.
- `YearZeroRoll.generateTermFormula(number, term, flavor, maxPush)`: Creates a roll formula based on number of dice.
- New optional parameter `options.yzur` in `YearZeroRoll` constructor to force the roll of a YearZeroRoll in Foundry.
- New global: `YZUR.Dice.DIE_TYPES` (DieTypeString[]).
- New type definitions (see documentation):
  - `DieTypeString`: Defines a type of a YZ die, its generic role and function.
  - `DieTermString`: Defines a term of a YZ die. It's a shortcut to its class.
  - `TermBlok`: An object that is used to define a YearZero DieTerm
  - `YearZeroDieTermResult`: Result of a rolled YearZero DieTerm
  - `DieClassData`: An object that is used to build a new class that extends the YearZeroDie class

### Changed

- `YearZeroRoll.forge()` has been refactored (see documentation), with the following:
  - Revamped `dice` parameter. Was: _DiceQuantities_ `Object.<DieTermString, number>`. Now: `TermBlok` (can be an array), which is an object `{ term: DieDeno, number: number, flavor?: string, maxPush?: number }`.
    - It is now possible to directly pass a flavor to a die term.
    - Note: The function **still** accepts an old _DiceQuantities_ format in the `dice` parameter for compatibility purposes. But it will log a deprecation warning in the console.
  - Added `options` parameter, which are passed in the roll object and saved in the Foundry database.
- **YZUR** globals have been renamed in order to follow good practices:
  - `YZUR.CHAT` becomes `YZUR.Chat`
  - `YZUR.ROLL` becomes `YZUR.Roll`
  - `YZUR.DICE` becomes `YZUR.Dice`
    - `YZUR.DICE.localizeDieTypes` becomes `YZUR.Dice.localizeDieTerms`
    - `YZUR.DICE.DIE_TYPES` becomes `YZUR.Dice.DIE_TERMS`
    - `YZUR.DICE.ICONS` becomes `YZUR.Icons`
- `YearZeroRollManager` member's `DIE_TYPES_MAP` becomes `DIE_TERMS_MAP`.
- `YearZeroRollManager` member's `GAMES` is now read-only (getter).
- `DieTypeError` becomes `DieTermError`.
- Refactored `YearZeroRollManager._overrideRollCreate()` for better checks.
- Refactored other methods for support of the new shiny things.

### Deprecated

- DOCUMENTATION.md is deprecated in favor of JSDocs-generated documentation.

### Removed

- `YearZeroRoll.getDiceQuantities()` was deprecated and has been removed. Use `count()` instead.
- `YZUR.DICE.DIE_TYPES_BY_CLASS` was deprecated and has been removed.
- `DiceQuantities` type definition is deprecated and removed.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-05-14

> :warning: **BREAKING CHANGE**
> Importing the module has changed (reverted back to previous).

```js
before: import YZUR from './dist/yzur.js';
after: import * as YZUR from './dist/yzur.js';
```

### Added

- Blade Runner RPG support.
- `isPrivate` in chat data for the roll template.

### Changed

- `YearZeroRoll.createFromDiceQuantities()` renamed to `forge()`. _(That function name was really too long.)_

### Removed

- YzurErrors removed from main export.
- `push` property in `YearZeroRoll.createFromDiceQuantities()`. _(Was useless.)_

### Fixed

- Some minor fixes.
- Updated the README and DOCUMENTATION help files.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-08-19

> :warning: **BREAKING CHANGE**
> The YZUR library is now compiled with rollup. Accessing the classes might have changed.

```js
before: import * as YZUR from './lib/yzur.js';
after: import YZUR from './dist/yzur.js';
```

### Added

- [Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md)!
- Expanded details in the readme.
- `YearZeroRoll#addDice(qty, type, options)`: Adds a number of dice to the roll.
- `YearZeroRoll#removeDice(qty, type)`: Removes a number of dice from the roll.
- `YearZeroRoll#create()`: Overrides the default Foundry's Roll method.
- "chatOptions" in `YearZeroRoll#render(chatOptions)` is passed to the renderTemplate with property "options".
- `YearZeroRollManager#_overrideRollCreate(i)`: Polyfills the default Foundry's Roll.create().

### Changed

- Rollup: the compiled `yzur.js` libraries are now artifacts in Github releases.
- `YearZeroRoll#count(type, seed, comparison)` is a bit refactored so it counts empty DiceTerms.
- `YearZeroRoll#modify(n)` is refactored and now modifies the roll instead of a copy of it. The old (fixed) modify method is still accessible with `_modify()`.
- `YearZeroRoll#getTerms(search)` now accepts also an object of comparaison values as an argument.

### Deprecated

- `YearZeroRoll#getDiceQuantities()` is now useless and will be removed in a future release.

### Removed

- Dropped `YearZeroRoll#data` in place of `YearZeroRoll#options`.
- Custom toJSON and fromData methods have therefore been dropped too.

### Fixed

- `YearZeroRoll#modify(n)` now retains all data/options set before.

## [2.1.1] - 2021-08-09

### Fixed

- A bug where setting the maxPush in the YearZeroRoll constructor was not working.

## [2.1.0] - 2021-08-02

### Added

- New properties on the Term level: `YearZeroDie#maxPush`: Max number of pushes for this term.
- New modifier for roll formulae: `np` (set maxPush to 0).
- New modifier for roll formulae: `pX` (set maxPush to X).
- `banes: this.failure` property in `YearZeroDie#getTooltipData()`.

### Changed

- `YearZeroRoll#maxPush` now acts on the Term level.

### Fixed

- A bug where it was not possible to set `maxPush = 0`.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-07-19

> :warning: **Breaking Change**
> Use `roll.successCount` instead of `roll.total`.

### Added

- The roll object is entirely passed to the chat template, for better access to its getters.
- Two new getters for the `YearZeroDie` class:
  - `.success`: Number of successes rolled by this Year Zero DieTerm
  - `.failure`: Number of banes rolled
- Placeholder for a future `YearZeroDie#nopush()` method.

### Changed

- Total number of success is returned by `YearZeroRoll#successCount`. _(Thus, the deprecation of this property is reverted.)_
- Total sum of the dice's values is returned by `YearZeroRoll#total`. _(Back to default behavior.)_

### Removed

- The DieTerm classes `NegativeDie` and `ArtifactDie` (which includes T2K dice) won't override the `.roll()` method anymore. No more `result.count` value for these dice. The calculation of successes is instead obtained with the `YearZeroDie#success` getter.

## [1.2.2] - 2021-07-17

### Added

- New getter for all `YearZeroDie` classes `.isYearZeroDie`: Tells whether it's a Year Zero Die. This property is also passed to the templates.

### Fixed

- Errors throwed when rolling unregistered dice that are still common like d4, d20 or d100.

## [1.2.1] - 2021-07-12

### Added

- New data option "title" (the name of the roll) for `YearZeroRoll#createFromDiceQuantities(dice, data)`.

### Fixed

- A bug where a modified roll would not keep its name.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-07-11

### Added

- New getters for the `YearZeroRoll`, mostly used by T2K:
  - `baseSuccessQty`: he total successes produced by base dice.
  - `hitLocations `: The rolled hit locations.
  - `bestHitLocation `: The best rolled hit location.
- Tooltip dice parts in the chat are now sorted.
- The sort order is stored in `YZUR.CHAT.diceSorting`.
- Plenty of CSS classes in the templates.

### Changed

- `YearZeroRoll#jamCount` now returns 0 if there are no bane on ammo dice.

### Fixed

- A bug where a modifier to a T2K roll could lead to an infinite loop.

## [1.1.1] - 2021-07-05

### Fixed

- Correct rendering of result labels.
- Ensure that `YZUR.DICE.ICONS.getLabel()` returns a string.
- A bug causing numerical result labels to throw an error in Dice So Nice!

## [1.1.0] - 2021-07-04

Last minute changes for T2K.

### Added

- New getters for the `YearZeroRoll`, mostly used by T2K:
  - `.jamCount`: The quantity of ones (banes) on base dice and ammo dice.
  - `.jammed`: Tells if the roll caused a weapon jam.
- Missing locked values for Ammo dice.
- Setting the global "`CONFIG.debug.dice = true`" will log the roll objects in the console.

### Changed

- Updated `infos.hbs` template with correct T2K weapon-related infos.

### Deprecated

- `YearZeroRoll.mishap` is deprecated (useless for now).

### Removed

- The two getters previously added. They were useless in fact:
  - `YearZeroRoll.baseBaneCount`
  - `YearZeroRoll.ammoBaneCount`

### Fixed

- `YearZeroRoll.ammoSpent` is now correctly returning the sum of the active values on ammo dice.
- Modifiers for T2K rolls now properly work as detailed in the rules.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-04
